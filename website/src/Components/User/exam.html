            <br> <br>  No student will resort to any unfair means of any nature while taking their
            examinations. If any student were found to be involved in using unfair means
            during an examination, the said student would be immediately expelled from
            the exam hall for that examination and the matter would be reported to the
            respective course instructor and the Dean (AP) for further action.
            <br> <br> In case a student is found to be copying from his/her fellow student, then
            both the parties, the one providing the assistance and the one seeking the
            same, would be punished for the same.
            <br> <br> In case a student has to leave his/her seat for whatever reason, he/she has to
            seek the permission of the concerned invigilator(s) of that exam hall before
            doing so. For visiting the rest room, he/she has to seek the permission of the
            concerned faculty invigilator of that examination hall before doing so.
            <br><br> No supplement(s) would be given to the students in the last 5 minutes of the
            examination.
